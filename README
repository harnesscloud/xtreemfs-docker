Dockerfiles to run the XtreemFS services in containers.

Service configuration files are expected to be mapped into /xtreemfs_data. The
config files have to be named dirconfig.properties, mrcconfig.properties,
osdconfig.properties, and schedulerconfig.properties. A new service can be
startet for instance by running

docker run -t -d -v /ssd:/xtreemfs_data xtreemfs/xtreemfs-harness-osd:latest

to run an XtreemFS OSD while the config is stored in /ssd/osdconfig.properties
on the host.
